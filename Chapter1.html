                        <h3>Java Language Feature</h3>
                        <p>Packages and classes: l
Class: A blueprint of an object. There must be at least one in a java program. It must have the main method. 
Package: A group of classes
Java.lang: This package, which contains many useful classes,  is always given already when you create a Java program.
Import: To use any other packages, use import. When you import a package you can use all the objects and methods in that package.
Importing all the classes in a package: import packagename.*;
Importing one class from the package: import packagename. (ClassName);
Importing classes from subpackages: import packagename.subpackage name.(ClassName);
Source files: The java files that make up the program.
Compiler: a thing that converts source code into a format machines can read called bytecode.
Java methods must be in a class, and program statements must be put inside a method
Classes that have the main method usually do not contain many other methods
Keywords: class, public, static, void, main
Public: everyone can access
Private: only you can access
Static: methods that will not have access to objects of the class. The main method is always static.


Types and identifiers:
Identifier:A specific name used to represent any user defined data set, such as a class or method.
Primitive variable:An integer, boolean, or double.
Integer:Any whole number, and does not include any decimals with the value.
Boolean:A value that is either True or False.
Double:Any number, and includes decimals as well as negative numbers.
Float:A value that contains 32 bits(definition of bit is explained later..)
IMPORTANT:Always use declaration when trying to introduce a new variable
ALSO IMPORTANT:It is impossible to assign a double to an int, as it cannot hold this value.However, it is possible to assign an int to a double, since the double has the capacity to contain that value.
Bit:Also known as binary digit, this value is named as the smallest value in Java.
Floating Point Number: A type of decimal.
Round off Error:When an error occurs in rounding a decimal value.
Final variable: a variable declared by final, which makes it permanent.



Operators: By Michael
Arithmetic Operators
Precedence: 
1: parentheses
2: *, /, %
3: +,-

Operator
Meaning
Example
+
addition
3 + x
-
subtraction
P - q
*
multiplication
6 * i
/
division
10/4: (returns 2, not 2.5)
%
mod(remainder)
11%8: (returns 3)

Can be applied to int and double
(double) ¾ = 0.75
(double)(¾) = 0

Relational Operators: used in boolean expressions for true or false
Int is promoted to a double
Do not compare floating values with relational operators
Operator
Meaning
Example
==
Equal to
If (x == 100)
!=
Not equal to 
If (age != 21)
>
Greater than
If (salary > 30000)

Less than
If (grade less than symbol 65)
>=
Greater than or equal to 
If (age >= 16)
less than equal symbol
Less than or equal to
If (height less than equal to symbol 6)

Logical Operators

Operator
Meaning
Example
!
NOT
If (!found)
double and symbol
AND
If (x less than symbol 3 double and symbol
||
OR
If (age less than symbol 2 || height less than symbol 4)

Connected to Boolean Expressions

Assignment Operators

Operator
Example
Meaning
=
x equal symbol 2
Simple assignment
+=
X += 4
X = x+4
-=
Y -= 6
Y = y -6
*=
P *= 5
P = p*5
/=
n/=10
N = n/10
%=
N %= 10
N = 

Increment and Decrement Operators

Operator
Example
Meaning
++
I++ or ++i
I is incremented by 1
--
K-- or --k
K is decremented by 1

Operator Precedence highest to lowest
!, ++, --
*, /, %
+,-
less than symbol,greater than symbol,greater than or equal to symbol,less than or equal to symbol
double equal symbol,!=
double and symbol
||
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Input/output:
IMPORTANT NOTES
1.System.out prints the output on a displayed line
2.Print.ln outputs result, then moves to the next line.
3.Input is given by the user’s choice.
4.Output items include strings, boolean values, or a number.
5.Use toString() when attempting to print user input data
6.Escape Sequence is a letter, with a backlash behind it, to print special output.
Storage of numbers:
Binary and hexadecimal numbers:
Hexadecimal Number:An exponent that uses an exponent base of 16 instead of the usual 10.
Binary Number: A number represented as 0 or 1.
Control structures:
Two types: decision making and iteration
Decision-Making: boolean expression, if, if else, switch
If Statement:
If (boolean)
{
Statement
}
The if else statement:
If (boolean)
{
Statement
}
Else
{
Statements
}

Nested if statement: if in an if statement

Iteration: for, while, and do while loop
For loop: 
for( some condition)
{
Statements
}
For-each loop:
for(some element)
{
Statements
}
The while loop
while(boolean test)
{
Statements
}

Errors and exceptions:
Exception:When an error occurs during the process of the code.
TYPES OF EXCEPTION
Unchecked Exception:When you do not get ready to advise the error that might occur by implementing the correct code.
Checked Exception:When code is given to advise the exception, but an unexpected error occurs.
